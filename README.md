#Merge Ruby Implementation

##Specs

`#binary_search` returns the index of an element if it exists in the array

##Steps

* Recall how `binary_search` works
* Write a test that will return an index of an element that is found
* Write a test that will return a `-1` when an element is NOT found in an array
* Write up to three more tests on your own that demonstrate solid edge-case coverage
